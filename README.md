**Developer:** Julia Fritsch  
**Project Type:** Experimental Narrative Game  
**Perspective:** First-Person Interface-Only

## Overview

Analog Dream Machine is a story-driven, UI-heavy first-person narrative game experienced entirely through a simulated CRT virtual machine.

The player interacts with Eidolon-9, an experimental analog consciousness archive designed to preserve human memory.

As the system destabilizes, memory becomes fragmented, poetic, and alive.
